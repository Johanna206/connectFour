Please see the first draft of my final project here:
https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Johanna206/connectFour/main/index.html
And please see the code here: 
https://github.com/Johanna206/connectFour/blob/main/index.html 

overall process for each turn: 
1) dropPiece - calculates which row to place the piece in 
    -> columnFull
2) displayPiece - draws the piece on the board
3) checkForWin - checks at the end of every turn to see if the game has been won or if it is still going
    -> endGame - displays a congratulations message to the winner and stops clicks from functioning
4) nextPlayer - switches between the two colors

remaining items to addres: 
none
